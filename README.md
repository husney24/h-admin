# H-Admin Dashboard

A clean and modern admin panel I built with React vite. It's got everything you need to manage services, projects, teams, and track analytics - all with a nice dark/light mode that actually works properly.

## The Analytics Page

This is probably the coolest part. It's like your command center for everything:

- **Revenue tracking** - See how much money's coming in, month by month
- **Project stats** - What's done, what's in progress, what's pending
- **Service performance** - Which services are crushing it (spoiler: e-commerce is at +31%)
- **Top clients** - Your MVPs ranked with satisfaction scores
- **Team performance** - How each team is doing
- **Geographic spread** - Where your clients are from
- **Tech stack usage** - What technologies you're using most
- **Smart insights** - Automated suggestions on what to focus on

You can filter by time (last week, month, year, whatever) and export everything if you need to.

## Tech Stack

Nothing fancy, just solid tools:
- React 19 (the latest one)
- React Router for navigation
- SCSS Modules for styling (keeps things organized)
- React Icons for all the icons
- Vite for super fast builds

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone it
git clone https://github.com/husney24/h-admin.git
cd h-admin

# Install stuff
npm install 

# Run it locally
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

Then just open `http://localhost:5173` and you're good to go.

## Customizing

Want to change colors? Check out `src/styles/_variables.scss` - all the colors are CSS variables so you can tweak them easily.

Need to add a new page? Create it in `src/pages`, add the route in `App.jsx`, and add it to the sidebar menu. Pretty straightforward.

## Design Philosophy

I kept it simple:
- Clean black and white with pops of color where needed
- 2px borders everywhere for better definition
- Smooth transitions but not overdone
- Works great in both light and dark mode
- Looks good on any screen size
